# Simula Cardiac Electro-Mechanics Solver

`simcardems` is a FEniCS-based cardiac electro-mechanics solver and is developed as a part of the [SimCardio Test project](https://www.simcardiotest.eu/wordpress/). The solver depends on [`pulse`](https://github.com/ComputationalPhysiology/pulse) and [`cbcbeat`](https://github.com/ComputationalPhysiology/cbcbeat).


## Installation

See [Installation instructions](docs/source/install.md)

## Getting started

See [Quickstart guide](docs/source/quickstart.md)
